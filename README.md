# odin-recipes

### Background
Honestly, I have finished FreeCodeCamp's responsive web design years ago. I haven't coded anything at all for the subsequent years. However, I have decided to level up to a full stack developer and found out that The Odin Project has a complete roadmap for achieving that. Now I'm here, sort of speedrunning things, since I know a bit of CSS I tried to add it to my "Odin Recipe" work so that it looks better.  

### Learnings
For the past few lessons I have learned about rel attribute for links and how some security issues can be mitigated.
